# Image to HTML table
 Turns image into an HTML table.

Basically [this](https://gist.github.com/TheFel0x/1623c8b0f56fbde4dd6152f41fc41b62), except not as a gist.

**Warning:** Depending on your browser and device large images might not load very well. Also file sizes are not small since each individual pixel requires HTML code. That's a lot of code for large images.
